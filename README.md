## Link to video: INSERT LINK HERE
## Lights used:
 - Directional light for sun
 - Point light for fire
 - Spotlight for light on campsite
 - 3D mesh emitter particle system for fish
## Particle System
 - 2D Texture emitter for fire
## What is your scene?
I made a circle island in the ocean with a lake in the middle, and an astronaut as the "main character" camping there.
## What kinds of objects did you include?
I mainly used low-poly objects to have that simple style, using nature props like trees, grass, rocks, flowers, etc. Also had camping props like tents, campfires, food, etc.
## Did anything inspire you?
I saw some renders online with that simple low poly design, and also in the assets store there are free assets with that low poly artstyle.
## What is the main character in this scene?
The main character in this scene is an astronaut camping on this island in the middle of the ocean.
